Here, in the teamcode folder, is where all the actual programs are. For this particular codebase, we've put all auto scripts in the auto folder, and all teleops in the teleop folder. The common folder is for things used by different types of programs (for example, the names of the robot motors are defined in common/HardwareDrive), and the concepts folder is just some slightly modified code from FTC's official examples (which can be found at /FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/). Lastly, roadrunner has stuff for roadrunner, which is a library for complicated robot motions.
